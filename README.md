## Architecture

This project uses BLoC for managing state hence it naturally uses the BLoC Architecture and feature first/layered architecture.

You can learn more about those from the following links;

[Layered Architecture](https://verygood.ventures/blog/very-good-flutter-architecture)


The app does not have a lot of moving parts, and the business logic end of things is tested properly.
